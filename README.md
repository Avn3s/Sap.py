## Clarification-cum-Warning
This was made simply for a school project by a jobless dude for the sake of marks. So do not use this unless you have nothing else to do.
I am an amateur coder and thus this program is probably EXTREMELY unoptimised and buggy. 
There are much better alternatives out there. So if you still plan on using this literal piece of garbage, do so at your own risk.
Any support from my side will be hugely limited.

## Requirements
1. The [python](https://www.python.org/) language (v3.10 or newer).
2. The [pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/) module (preferably the latest version) has to be installed beforehand in order to run the program.
3. A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) with ligatures, preferably [Fira Code](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode) (this step is recommended, but purely optional).

## Installing python
1. Go to [the python downloads page.](https://www.python.org/downloads)
2. Download the preferred installation file.
3. Install python via the installer.

## Installing pygame
 1. Download the package (see below).
 2. Run requirementinstaller.py
 3. Wait till installation completes.
 4. Close the app once it says 'Pygame Successfully installed!'.
 5. If you are lazy, just wait for 5 seconds. The app should close itself.

## Installing a Nerd Font
 1. Just google it ig im lazy.
 2. Watch solo leveling.

## Usage:
 1. Click on 'Code' and hit 'download zip'.
 2. Unzip the archive.
 3. Run requirementinstaller.py
 4. Open soundapp.py
 5. Type 'h' and hit enter when the prompt comes up.
 6. Enjoy.

 ## Also Note:                                                                                                
This program can play .mp3, .wav, .ogg files ONLY as of now.                                              
 Support for other formats may be there, but it has not been tested.                                       
 Also, this program can only play pre-downloaded songs. It CAN NOT download them from the internet.        
 To add your own songs, please download the .mp3 or .wav files and drop them into the 'songs' folder.      
 To delete songs, simply delete the corresponding audio file from the songs folder.

 ## Credits
 A huge shoutout to [pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/) for the library.
