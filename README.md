## Clarification-cum-Warning
This was made simply for a school project by a jobless dude for the sake of marks. So do not use this unless you have nothing else to do.
I am an amateur coder and thus this program is probably EXTREMELY unoptimised and buggy. 
There are much better alternatives out there. So if you still plan on using this literal piece of garbage, do so at your own risk.
Any support from my side will be hugely limited.

## Requirements
The pygame module (preferably the latest version) has to be installed beforehand in order to run the program.            
To do so, follow the steps: 
 1. Open a terminal or cmd prompt                                                                          
 2. Run the following
 ```bash
python -m pip install pygame
```                                
 3. Wait till it says something like "Pygame successfully installed"                                       
 4. Close the terminal.                                                                                    
 5. Follow the steps to start the program.                                                                 
  
## Usage:
 1. Keep the 'sudeep' folder open and type cmd in the search bar.                                          
 2. Type 'soundapp.py' in the prompt and run (without quotes again).                                       
    Alternatively, follow step 1 and then drag the 'soundapp.py' file into the terminal and run.                       
 3. Enjoy.                                                                                                 
  
 ## Also Note:                                                                                                
This program can play .mp3, .wav, .ogg files ONLY as of now.                                              
 Support for other formats may be there, but it has not been tested.                                       
 Also, this program can only play pre-downloaded songs. It CAN NOT download them from the internet.        
 To add your own songs, please download the .mp3 or .wav files and drop them into the 'songs' folder.      
 To delete songs, simply delete the corresponding audio file from the songs folder.
