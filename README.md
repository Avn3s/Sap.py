|    The pygame module (latest version) has to be installed beforehand in order to run the program.           |
|    To do so, follow the steps:                                                                              |
|    1. Open a terminal or cmd prompt                                                                         |
|    2. Run "python -m pip install pygame" (without the quotes of course)                                     |
|    3. Wait till it says something like "Pygame successfully installed"                                      |
|    4. Close the terminal.                                                                                   |
|    5. Follow the steps to start the program.                                                                |

|    To start the program:                                                                                    |
|    1. Keep the 'sudeep' folder open and type cmd in the search bar.                                         |
|    2. Type 'soundapp.py' in the prompt and run (without quotes again).                                      |
|       Or follow step 1 and then drag the 'soundapp.py' file into the terminal and run.                      |
|    3. Enjoy.                                                                                                |

|    Also Note:                                                                                               |
|    This program can play .mp3, .wav, .ogg files ONLY as of now.                                             |
|    Support for other formats may be there, but it has not been tested.                                      |
|    Also, this program can only play pre-downloaded songs. It CAN NOT download them from the internet.       |
|    To add your own songs, please download the .mp3 or .wav files and drop them into the 'songs' folder.     |
|    To delete songs, simply delete the corresponding audio file from the songs folder.                       |
